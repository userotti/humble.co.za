           <p>Our founders, Rodney and William, have spent most of their careers in the Cellular industry and have 
            taken what they have learnt and used their experience gained over the years to create products that really improve the cellular retail experience.
            Rodney met William at a Vodacom Franchise Conference in 2005. Their friendship was cemented due to a common love of gadgets and getting software to do really 'cool' things.

Rodney has grown up in the Telecommunications industry, with his family having been involved
in the industry right from the days of Two-
way radios and Radio Pagers. Rodney studied electronic engineering with his major being
in communications. Once he had completed
his studies, he joined Vodacom as a Network Engineer in 1999.

          <p>
          After 4 years with
Vodacom and having gained great insight and understanding of how a cellular network actually operates from the ground up, he left Vodacom to open his own Vodashop Franchise Store in the Pietermaritzburg Midlands Mall.

William worked in the Retail Solutions team within Vodacom. Specialising in point-of-sale systems, William was originally involved in adapting the UCS till to work for the cellular industry. It was the first till to handle cellular tariffs and rebates. He later became involved in other projects and come up with some really great ideas, like getting the till to “talk” to the Servicebase repair system, so that the repairs could seamlessly be rung up on the till for the Vodacare repair outlets.

          <p>
            On
the retail side he made fundamental changes
to the way that contracts deals were handled. Previously these deals had to be loaded by
hand. William integrated these deals with the ERP system so that they loaded directly into the till. This vastly improved accuracy and not only saved the industry a lot of money but also loads of time.

 Later, William went on to integrate the till with the insurance company, so when an insurance claim was captured, the claim instantly got processed in the back end.
